# TheUnderWonder

Its a e-com app.

this is the first prototype.
the application has the same name with my aunt's store on Etsy. She makes 3d models in zbrush. She also sews cute textile dolls, which will be posted in this app.

The application is entirely written in SwiftUa. Following the guides and advice of Robert Petras.


In the future, the application will add:
- the ability to receive an order through the application
- rating the product after purchase
- like the product
- the ability to chat with the buyer
- the ability to make a custom order
- storage of files on a remote server
- Product categorization (categories have already been created)
- Product description
- client login window
- payment connection (PayPal)

If you have any more thoughts, I will add functionality
